\begin{itemize}\item Consensus Definition \citep{Gottfredson1997}\\~\\
``Intelligence is a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly and learn from experience. \textbf{It is not merely book learning, a narrow academic skill, or test-taking smarts. Rather it reflects a broader and deeper capability for comprehending our surroundings} -- `catching on,' `making sense' of things, or `figuring out' what to do.''
