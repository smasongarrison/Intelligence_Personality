\item Fluid -- Crystallized Distinction \citep{Cattell1941, Horn1965}\\~\\
\begin{itemize}\item Fluid Intelligence\\
is the ability to think systematically and solve problems in novel situations.\\~\\
\item Crystallized Intelligence\\
is the capacity to use reason, information, and experience. I like to think of it as ``knowledge,'' and that is the product of our accumulated experiences interacting with fluid intelligence.

\begin{itemize}\item Cattell-Horn-Carroll Theory\\
is the integration of Cattell and Horn's theory within Carroll's structural model. The broad abilities are:\\
\begin{enumerate}\item Crystallized Intelligence (Gc)\\~\\
\item Fluid Intelligence (Gf)\\~\\
\item Quantitative Reasoning (Gq)\\~\\
\item Reading & Writing Ability (Grw)\\~\\
\item Short-Term Memory (Gsm)\\~\\
\item Long-Term Storage and Retrieval (Glr)\\~\\
\item Visual Processing (Gv)\\~\\
\item Auditory Processing (Ga)\\~\\
\item Processing Speed (Gs)\\~\\
\item Decision/Reaction Time/Speed (Gt)
